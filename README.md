Project Spotlight: SuperLife
---
PwC Consulting, in collaboration with SuperLife, has created a health incentive program to be incorporated into SuperLife’s longer-term life insurance offerings. Being one of major life insurance carriers in the country of Lumaria, the primary objectives of the proposed program will be to improve policyholders’ expected mortality, add economic value to SuperLife and as a result increase SuperLife’s insurance sales and market competitiveness.

### Program Overview
Leverage Fitbit smartwatches to create a Digital Wellness Ecosystem. Superlife would provide all its policyholders with these smartwatches that not only serve the purpose of tracking fitness activity and health monitoring, but double down as a medium for Superlife to effectively reach out to
policyholders through its intervention programs.

3) health screenings and smoking cessation programs
