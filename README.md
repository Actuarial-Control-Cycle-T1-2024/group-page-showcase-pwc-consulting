PwC Consulting, in collaboration with SuperLife, has created a health incentive program to be incorporated into SuperLife’s longer-term life insurance offerings. Being one of major life insurance carriers in the country of Lumaria, the primary objectives of the proposed program will be to improve policyholders’ expected mortality, add economic value to SuperLife and as a result increase SuperLife’s insurance sales and market competitiveness.


### Program Overview
Leverage Fitbit smartwatches to create a Digital Wellness Ecosystem. Superlife would provide all its policyholders with these smartwatches that not only serve the purpose of tracking fitness activity and health monitoring, but double down as a medium for Superlife to effectively reach out to
policyholders through its intervention programs. 

The Fitbit smartwatches would incorporate three interventions:
1) fitness tracking incentives
2) incentives for preventive
3) health screenings and smoking cessation programs


### Why these interventions?
The Log Rank Test highlighted that the mortality rate for policyholders who smoked was 23.17% compared to 2.84% for non smokers. Furthermore, the coefficient for Smoking Status for individuals was notable at 1.903 under the Cox Regression even at a significance level of 0.1%, emphasizing the need for targeted Smoking Cessation programs to decrease policyholder mortality. 

### Actuarial Analytics Conducted
* Pricing and Costs
* Sensitivity analysis on interest rates and mortality rates
* Risks and Risks Mitgation Strategies
